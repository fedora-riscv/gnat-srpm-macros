# GNAT_arches lists the architectures where GNAT is available in Fedora. Ada
# packages won't build on other architectures until GNAT is bootstrapped for
# them.
# (Although not all of these architectures have active maintainer teams in
# Fedora, it seems appropriate to keep this list in agreement with the one in
# gcc.spec.)

# GPRbuild_arches lists the architectures where GPRbuild is available in Fedora.
# If an architecture is included in GNAT_arches but not in GPRbuild_arches, then
# either GPRbuild hasn't been bootstrapped for that architecture, or there might
# be some architecture-specific problem.
